# Things to work on

- A way to logging
- Work on architecture:
    - Make an image and add number on the list. Each number would be either a hardware or a software for example (S1) which would be software 1 and (H1) would be hardware one.
    - Make different configurations: one with ground station that handles all the loads and another with three different ground computers that handle the load of each image
    - Work on trying to share the same world (referance points) of the three drones

# Experiments

- Test three cameras with three different pc
    - and gather information on the ground station
- Test one ground stations that handles three different cameras
    - The ground station would share the world for tracking, test in the same world space

# Maybe

- Work on sharing the same space and three cameras try to find one item in the world. When one camera finds the object the rest should know where that objetc is.
