* Algorithm
  * \[X\] Control Drone through script
  * \[X\] Drone spins on the z-axis
  * \[X\] Drone detects objects using ros-yolo
  * \[X\] Drone moves forward when an object is detected
  * \[X\] Drone yaws to keep the object in frame
  * \[X\] Drone can stop when the bounding box is a certain size
  * \[X\] Drone moves along the z-axis to follow a ball that changes altitudes
    * \[ \] Make the drone more stable when changing altitudes
  * \[ \] Implement a tracker after detection
* Trackers

      - [ ] Look for ros trackers
          1. [X] Download matlab
      - [ ] Test a tracker vs Object detection through ros
* Simulation
  * \[X\] Make a ball attached to a drone
  * \[X\] Make yolo recognize the drone
  * \[ \] Make the target drone fly in a figure 8
  * \[ \] Make the target drone move faster and slower
